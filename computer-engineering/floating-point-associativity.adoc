= Floating Point Associativity

Floating point operations are not guaranteed associativity as there are inherent
limitations on how data can be stored and operated on. A long series of
additions on the same floating-point values can result in different outcomes.
(This is contrary to purely analytical solutions where this is not a concern.)

Digits on the smaller end of the significant figures are most likely to be
affected, as that is where imprecision has its most noticeable effect.
